# AND Challenge 5

Using A-Frame with an experimental version of React for async rendering + Redux for data management

Tested in Firefox with Valve Index + Controllers, as well as in Chrome with mouse + keyboard

Chrome needed to be ran in non-sandboxed mode + beta to get VR working where the controller support was very broken. It
does appear to have MUCH better performance, running at the full 144fps vs 60-80 in Firefox though :'(

Seems like a lot of things can/will be broken based on the browser's support for WebVR vs newer WebXR spec
